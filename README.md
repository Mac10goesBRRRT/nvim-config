# Lachstecs' Neovim Configuration
This repository contains my lua configuration for neovim. You are free to use this for yourself, if you like to.

## Getting started.
I assume that you already have Neovim installed. To get started with my configuration, simply create the directory `~/.config/` and run this command inside it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lachstec/nvim-config nvim
```
You can then simply start Neovim, and the config should bootstrap itself, installing all of the plugins specified in `plugins/plugins.lua`.
